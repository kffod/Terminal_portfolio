First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kffod/Terminal_portfolio.git
```
###2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Go to the directory where you cloned the project:
```
cd Terminal_portfolio
```
###3. Install Dependencies
If your project uses any package managers like npm (for Node.js projects), install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
###4. Start the Local Server
If you're using a simple HTML/CSS/JS setup, you can start a local server with the following command:
```
npx  serve
```
Or, if you're using a specific framework like React:
```
npm start
```
###5. Open the Application
Once the server is up and running, open your browser and go to the following address to view the website locally:
```
http://localhost:3000
```


### Key Additions:
- **How to Deploy Locally**: Added detailed instructions on how to clone, install dependencies, start a local server, and view the portfolio on `localhost`.
